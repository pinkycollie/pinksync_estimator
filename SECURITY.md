# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in the security of this project!

> **Note:** This security policy was written to be thorough—perhaps even to the point of being "overextended" when it comes to privacy and disclosure. We value your privacy highly; some measures may seem exhaustive, but they reflect our commitment to protecting both our users and contributors. Still, we try to keep things practical—so, eh, we don't mind a little extra!

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the latest release of this project. 
Older versions may not receive security updates. If you are using an older version, please consider updating to the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.  
Instead, please report it privately via email:

- **Email:** [pinky@360magicians.com]  

Please include as much detail as possible:
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any proposed mitigation or patch if available

We will respond as quickly as possible, typically within 2-5 business days. You will be kept informed of our progress as we investigate and address the issue.

## Project Dependencies

- This project uses multiple languages: TypeScript, Python, PowerShell, CSS, Dockerfile, and HTML.
- We regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities using appropriate ecosystem tools (e.g., npm audit, pip audit).
- If you notice a security issue with any project dependency, please let us know and, if possible, provide a CVE or advisory link.

## Best Practices

- Keep your local environment and tools up to date.
- Do not share sensitive credentials or secrets in issues, code, or pull requests.
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication where possible.

## Disclosure Policy

We will acknowledge your report within 5 business days and provide an estimated timetable for a fix where possible. Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities will be coordinated to ensure users can patch or mitigate risks before full details are announced.

## Questions?

If you have further questions about the security policy or practices, please open a discussion or contact the maintainers.
